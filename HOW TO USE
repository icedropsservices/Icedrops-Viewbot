# STEPS AND INSTALLATION
First, you need to install the necessary libraries by running pip install selenium in your command prompt or terminal.

Download the WebDriver for your preferred browser (Microsoft Edge or Chrome) from the links provided in the code comments.

Replace "path/to/edge/driver" and "path/to/chrome/driver" with the actual paths to the WebDriver executables you downloaded.

Replace "VIDEO_ID" with the actual ID of the YouTube video you want to simulate views for.

Choose whether you want to use Microsoft Edge or Chrome by setting the browser variable to "edge" or "chrome".

Create an instance of the YouTubeViewBot class, passing the chosen browser as an argument: view_bot = YouTubeViewBot(browser).

Call the run method of the view_bot instance, passing the URL of the video, the number of views to simulate, and a boolean indicating whether it's a livestream or not: view_bot.run(url, num_views, is_live).

The viewbot will open the specified video in the chosen browser and simulate the specified number of views.


For example:
url = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
num_views = 1000
is_live = False
browser = "chrome"

view_bot = YouTubeViewBot(browser)
view_bot.run(url, num_views, is_live)

This will open the video with the specified ID in Chrome, simulate 1000 views, and determine if it's a livestream or not based on the value of is_live.
